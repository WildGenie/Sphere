[== Exploits/Bugfixes ==]
- One item/pile sell time should be limited to 0.3 sec (disables autobuy/autosell, inject)
- Close up all possible ways getting zero-or-negative stats
- @Destroy seems not executed http://www.sphereserver.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=32982&hl=
- Criminal bug - you hit other's npc (like by magic arrow), it hits you, and the owner of the pet
  is now a criminal.
- Deny throwing items by Z coord (height). They should go to the some surface. Thus, ground and air disabled.
- Bug with placing unlimited same-type items to the bank (if targeted stacking the similar object).
- Date calculation incorrect (like in connectdate in accounts unused)
  http://www.sphereserver.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=33678&hl=
- Try does not work with locals
- OF_Items_AutoName causes explosion potion (exploded/crafted?) named to <SERV.SPELL.<>.NAME>
- Some script errors in loops cause server to hang, like "LOCAL.N -= LOCAL.M>"

[== CRs (Change Requests) ==]
- RESDISP:
  Combining ResDisp + Ef_Aos for feature packet sending
  Other things (new packet parsing, status sending)
  Add to STATS new AoS things (Ice,Poison,Fire,Light,Luck ecc)
- Mapdiffs support (see bottom of the cGrayMap.cpp)

[== New Features ==]
- Add @PartyJoin, @PartyLeave and @PartyInvite.
- newequip (creates a new item, equips it), newloot (creates a new item or loot template, sticks it on a corpse in @death events), 
- equipprops (example equipprops 10.0 magery, 10 dex - would give 10.0 magery and 10 dex on equip, remove it on unequip, placed in @Create on an item)
  ( k: doable by adding a simple resourcegroup field to items/itemdefs )
- damtype for itemdef base = 0002 | 0010 // physical & fire
- ON=@CharDCLICK
- ON=@Karma, ON=@Fame
- useful 99/1.0 features (my comment in brackets - Vjaka):
  Script error will jump out of current block. (should simulate endif)
  Allow NPC to summon pets.
  loot from blue says you need to steal ?
  floating point support for scripts.
  multithread protect atoms and dont create atom to search for tag
  LinkFile and LinkLine as props of triggered items
  multi cliloc 0 (what's fuckin this?)
  region_flag_underground should be replaced by region_flag_roof in map.scp files where appropriate.
  Read resource level from client logging in. detect AOS
  ODBC access to reading accounts (actualy ODBC suxxs, but just as a sample)
  MENU, DIALOG, the same (menu=dialog).
  Track FRIEND memories of my pets.
  TAG.CORPSEID for CHARDEF to change the corpse.
  DESIRES= for setting ally groups with NPC's (just review if this is really needed and usable)
  MaxCharsPerAccount should work (support of 6+ chars?).
  MapDif files supported
  Papua house ladders work.
  no animation of player corpses.
  drop on vendor to trade quick
  Jailed evil not killed by guards.
- ZIP archiving/dearchiving methods for worldsaves autoarchiving on save and dearchiving on load
- @sawcrime called right after someone commits a crime and right before the npc see's the crime
- @NpcAction called when npc is selecting a skill to start
- @UserGuildButton for new clients (they no longer have chat button)
- Allow putting dialog commands from the functions called from dialogs
- <?notag .....?> means that all text between <?notag -and- ?> will be plain text with any chars inside (not parsed)
- MySQL:
  make accounts connecting/disconnecting to the DB, saving and loading to/from it
  maybe maintain persistent link? to allow one connection for large amount of time withour reconnects
  add ability to execute sql queries from scripts (maybe also get the result)

[== Algourythm Ideas ==]
- New script system with scripts precompiled on loading and only the binary execution will take place
  it will cause some language changes.
- Resources optimisation
  dual sell list: like one like currently the container, and the other - dynamically generated upon
    SELL/BUY settings of a char. this will elimenate neccessaty to have tons of items by each vendor in world,
    heavily decreasing lags.
    the only problem is the amount of resources the vendor can maintain, but i think that the list could be
    generated upon SELL dialog request and then the whole stock of itesm not having special VALUE set on them
    removed on timer so, autorestock will be done.
    in this way the amount-to-stock in SELL/BUY lists will work like should
  resources extraction: 6144x4096 - 25mb if struct is 1 byte in size, if 2 bytes - resourceid, 2 amount left,
    much but quick and no items uids/items, nothing. btw, it could be 4 bytes, 2 resourceid, 1 amount, 1
    reserved with 2 bits meaning resource type - log/ore/fish. if we will limit 1 resource spawn per step, than
    it will be 100mb for no items lags. not bad actualy ;), worth to try, problem will be making resourceid to
    fit 2 bytes ;). But, if having multimaps/mapplanes, than we will have 256*100mb ;)
    so, we can add this to sphere config. making this to work on multiply planes at once, like wish optimisation
    use that. if wish mapplanes (rare people uses that) - use default
- Redo system of saving/loading to support 3 formats : text/binary/sql
