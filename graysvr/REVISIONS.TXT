---- 0.56a --------------------------------------------------------------------
---- 08/12/2004

06-10-04, Vjaka
- Removed DISGUISE(NAME/VERSION), renamed the current version to 0.56a.

07-10-04, Vjaka
- Removed AGREE config line neccessaty since it is not longer R* series.
- Added startup expansion set support output depending on map*,statics*,staidx*
  files found and loaded (T2A, LBR, AOS, SE).
- Removed EF_New_Maps since it is integrated to source now, packet is sent when
  needed.
- Moving on other map now moves the same map on the server. But this currently
  does not use caching and re-read tile information from map files every time.
  Caching of same sectors but in different mapplanes will be in the future.
  You should both add regions for these maps, and place corresponding files in
  place where all other mul files resides.
- Changed values of EXPERIMENTAL flags to remove empty slots between items.

08-10-04, Vjaka
- Fixed memory leak caused by map cache removal.
- Fixed client screen update on map change.

08-10-04, Furio
- Added PROMPTCONSOLE, it makes the client prompt (like on page request) and send
  the response as an argument of a user definied function.
  (syntax PROMPTCONSOLE callback function, message to prompt)
  
10-10-04, Furio
- Added RESDISP properties to account. Accepted values are 0 (PreT2a client),
  1 (T2A), 2 (LBR), 3 (AoS), 4 (Samurai Empire). This is used to identify what type
  of client is logged in. As default is set at 0, but if the client is T2A is
  automatically set to 1 by Sphere. LBR, AoS and SE is not setted automatically and
  is leaved to you.
- Added to CHARDEF properties RESLEVEL, RESDISPDNID, RESDISPDNHUE. The first state
  from what UO version the anim comes. The second what anim id is showed to older
  client version. The third an hue showed to older client (if 0 or null the default
  anim hue is used.
- Modified scriptpack to reflect these changes for T2A monsters.

22-10-04, Vjaka
- Added <dVALUE> as a shortcut to <eval <VALUE>> to get a decimal value of a
  single expr like a variable. Note, this affects EF_Intrinsic_Locals a bit.
- Commands with .command and spaces before will be treated as without spaces,
  since extra space makes privileged chars to reveal self.
- Added TAG.PARTY_CANLOOTME for party. If 1, allows party to loot self.
- Added @Kill trigger (SRC-killer, ARGO-killed)
- Added sector function ALLCHARS,ALLITEMS similar to ALLCLIENTS. For regions
  you can use SECTORS.ALLCHARS, SECTORS.ALLITEMS.
- Changed GODPORT to accept port number as well. Old values ( <=0 = disables,
  1=ServPort+1000) are still working also.
- Added SYSCMD and SYSSPAWN commands to run external applications. Returns <0 if
  there was an error. The first one blocks while program is running while the
  second spawns and continues scripts execution. Due to obvious security fear
  in these commands, they are disabled if OF_FileCommands is not set. Up to 9
  command line arguments are passed to the external application.

23-10-04, Furio
- Fixed minor things in grayproto.
- Updated grayproto (list/sizes of Uo packet in Sphere).
- Finished and debugged the new crypt engine (for crypt clients). Currently up
  to latest current OSI client 4.0.5a is supported.

25-10-04, Vjaka
- Fixed exception in writefile when unable to open the file.
- Added account name output when packet dispatch generated an exception.

25-10-2004. Furio
- Still updated grayproto, with new packet infos.

26-10-04, Vjaka
- Fixed SMSG[u] resolve error.
- Fixed <dSOMEVAL> giving some hex results.
- Added update for items moved by NPCs when they blocks the path.

27-10-04, Vjaka
- Now Windows build tryes to use winsock 2.0 if available instead of 1.1.
- Added amount argument to NEWITEM (newitem i_gold,45). Defaults to 1.
- Removed one of occasions with creating an extra log not in logfile path.

27-10-04, Furio
- Fixed a bug in displaying big dialogs with newer clients (4.0.X).
- Fixed a bug where some clients were crashing when adding an item.

28-10-04, Vjaka
- Disabled string 'q'/'Q' to be said by privileged accounts. It is due the
  fact that default macro for repeat is Ctrl+Q, and one less Ctrl press will
  lead to GM to reveal self existance around, which really is not good.
  
31-10-04, Furio
- Some fixes related to account creation and bank/box hack.
- Removed EF_AgeOfShadows. It'll be re-added with new features and complete
  compatibility for older clients, when enabled.
- Fixed another exploit with Bullettin Boards. Thx to Balkon for reporting it.

01-11-04, Vjaka

- Consume now can take more than 65k at once.
- Added @CreatePlayer to trigger just after the char was created by a player.

05-11-04, Vjaka
- Now "Admin" is shown instead of "GM" if person is admin or owner in title.

06-11-04, Vjaka
- Added sector function ALLCHARSIDLE similar to ALLCHARS, but looping via
  disconnected/mounted/etc chars, not accessable by ALLCHARS.
- Added auto map fix to zero map if it is out of bounds. Please note, that
  this can cause some problems with MOREM usage as well.

25-11-04, Furio
- Fixed: encryption - client login.
- Fixed: dVALUE evaluating when VALUE is already int.
- Fixed: EQUIPHALO <timer> does not making the light disappearing.

- Fixed canmove to accept DIR values (0..8) in addition to a letter arguments.
  Same changes affects other places, like move command, etc.
- File locking method optimised. It should improve the multithreading a bit.
- Result of the old "ACCOUNT accname" command changed to be more informational.
- GMs should login with invul and without allshow flags set.
- If reference set to OBJ/NEW does not exist, zero will be storied instead. And
  opposite, if it is already deleted, OBJ/NEW value is cleared to zero.
- Fixed exception in f_onaccount_login.

08-12-2004, Various authors
- Fixed some scripts by Vjaka.
- Added new scripts and scripts fixes by Tattooed Corpse.

---- 0.56b --------------------------------------------------------------------
---- * not released yet

09-12-04, Vjaka
- Added map caching supporting all maps. Due to this, sectors are no longer
  same in the same spot in different maps, allowing local settings for maps.
- Added ADDCIRCLE=x[,y] to add a circle to a character's spellbook. If y is on,
  includes all lower spell circles as well.
- File locking method optimised. It should improve the multithreading a bit.
- Changed [SECTOR x,y] in world saves to x,y,0,map to allow local settings for
  sectors in different maps. Old format will default to map 0.
- Since sectors are no longer shared witheen different maps, sectors on maps,
  unsupported by server (having no corresponding .mul files) do not get ticks.
- Fixed cause to duplicate saved items in static saves in several occasions.
- Added BADSPAWN command to jump to the first bad spawn found in the world. You
  should add this to some of the [PLEVEL records. It also saves the UID into
  ACT in case you unable to see it due to some obstacles.
- Removed useless PRIVHIDE (privshow 0/1 is enough for this).

10-12-04, Vjaka
- Fixed some defmessages misprint making unable to override them.
- Fixed @Kill to trigger even if the killer is not an agressor in the fight.
- Changed MAPPLANE->MAP, LOCALLIGHT->LIGHT (.56a supported both variants, but
  saved the second). Launch and save in .56a will autoconvert this in saves.
- Now any items with ATTR_STATIC are saved to spherestatics.scp, not only those
  who has this flag being the only set.
- Fixed carriage return in accounts unused message.
  
11-12-04, Furio
- Fixed: bugs with FORCONT* loops.
- Fixed: bug with coloured text in comm crystal.
- Added: SKILLGAIN function to call internal sphere skillgain function. Args are
  skill to gain and difficulty (0 to 100).
- Added: REPORTEDCLIVER property for clients. It'll contain the version that
  the client is. (this is easy fakeable by 3rd party programs, but still is
  useful)

13-12-04, Vjaka
- Fixed resolving functions executing on containers, if the name started from
  rescount,restest,fcount or count.
- Fixed isneartype not working if calling under points (like from TARGP).

17-12-04, Vjaka
- Account delete information now contains account name.
- Added NPC keyword GOTO x,y,z,map to execute sphere default movements there.
- Redone pathfinding to support separate thread execution, so it now utilizes
  extra thread if OF_Multithreaded is set.
- Advanced AI now includes food search on hunger to eat and gather meal around.
  It is executed in separate thread with pathfinding if configured so.

21-12-04, Vjaka
- Changed sector allocations, now allocates only those who are needed by the
  server depending on the *.mul files found. Thus, on bare t2a install no space
  for other maps will be allocated (saves several Mbytes).
- Random selection {x y} now supports format {x,y} also. Should help using it
  with DAM/AR fields of items.
- Added EXP field to characters. No internal support for it yet. But you can
  use it in scripts already.
- Empty accounts file is created on-fly if not found. Useful for unpack-n-run.
- Fixed bug with TOTALCONNECTTIME being increased by doubled value, and now is
  made more accurate.
- Optimized the UID allocation routine, trying to disallow creating holes in
  objects allocation. This should improve memory neccessaty increase for large
  or long-lasting servers. Howewer, this does not defrag the current save, only
  newly generated UIDs will be optimized - no existant UIDs will be altered.
  Garbage Collection should be enabled for this optimization to work.
- Expanded account information in ACCOUNT NAME command by logged char name.

03-01-05, Vjaka
- Added <Rarguments> as a shortcut to <eval rand(arguments)>. Can take either
  one, two or no arguments like <R>, <R15>, <R3,15>. If no arguments given,
  R1000 is assumed.
- You can now disable broadcast messages (like errors, connects, etc) from the
  server log to be sent to your account logged via telnet. You can toggle this
  behavior per account via PRIV field of the account (mask 0400). So, only
  responces to your commands and some very-basic messages (like world save)
  will be sent in this case.

08-01-05, Vjaka
- Added support for virtual maps. Now map numbers 0..255 are supported by the
  server.
- Map dimensions are now customizable in INI-file using by the following cmd:
  MAPx=max_x,max_y,sector_size,real_map_number.
  Here x - the map number for ingame useage (4rd coordinate of the coordinate).
  max_x - maximal X coordinate of the map (should be multiply of 8).
  max_y - maximal Y coordinate of the map (should be multiply of 8).
  sector_size - the sector size (you can play with this if you experience lags
    decreasing this value (should be multiply of 8 and both max_x and max_y).
  real_map_numer - number used by map files (like: 0 for map0, statics0).
  You can also change some attribute of the current map not redefining all
  values, skipping the ones you wish to be as default putting 0 instead (for
  real map number -1). For example, decreasing sector size for map 0 to 16
  from default value of 64 will look in INI file thus: "MAP0=0,0,16,-1".
  Please note, that no changes are applied when server is already started.
- Default map numbering has been changed (you can ovverride it easily by MAPx
  setting in sphere.ini). Now 0 = map0, 1 = map0, 2 = map2, 3 = map3, 4 = map4.

10-01-05, Furio
- Added: tooltip %d command for gumps (works in SE clients).
- Added: sphere_map*.scp/sphere_map_points*.scp for new maps and fixed the
  default one.
- Updated: gray proto with new packets.
- Updated: client support to 4.0.7 family.
- Updated: fix in default script pack.

13-01-05, Furio
- Modified SERV.MAP(x,y) to accept a 3rd parameter, the map. If omitted is
  defaulted to 0.
- Added SECTOR access to read-only properties from a point. Example:
  SERV.MAP(100,100,1).SECTOR.ITEMCOUNT will give you the itemcount of the
  sector that contains the point 100,100 on map 1.
- Added REGION access to read-only properties from a point. (works like
  SECTOR one)
- Fixed: gumppic to show hue when used. (Hue usable only for client >= 3)

15-01-05, Vjaka
- Changed the way the server saves allowing more information about the cause of
  some exception (which is now not fatal for the save).

17-01-05, Vjaka
- Added LEVEL field to char as the future part of the experience system.
- Added ExperienceSystem, ExperienceMode, LevelSystem, LevelMode, LevelNextAt
  fields to the .INI file as a future part of the experience system. Read the
  default sphere.ini for more description over these fields.
- PRIV flags are now auto-clearing bits corresponding to not used priv. This is
  a solution for a possible incompatibility when the previosely disabled bit
  will be reused with other functionality on same world saves.
- Fixed: LAYER_EXTRA is now used ONLY to place the items bought by the vendor.
- Items sold to vendors are auto-deleted exactly upon the sell operation. The
  only case they are saved, if they are sold to player vendors.
- Amount of items in sell packet is now limited to the container size.
- Fixed one more sell/buy exploit.

17-01-05, Furio
- Fixed: party system.
- Fixed: group disappeared from gumps.
- Added: scriptable components for the party. Still work in progress.
  With <REF>.PARTY refer to the current party of the char.
  	   <REF>.PARTY.MEMBER.x refer to any member of the party.
       <REF>.PARTY.MASTER refer to the master of the party.
  PARTY.MEMBERS give the count of members
  PARTY.MEMBER.x has also ISMASTER and ISLOOTABLE properties.
  PARTY.ADDMEMBER[FORCED] you can add a meber by script (forced  version works
       without the normal /accept behaviour)
  PARTY.DISBAND disband the current party
  PARTY.REMOVEMEMBER @<N> remove the Nth member
  PARTY.REMOVEMEMBER <UID> remove a member in the party with the UID given
       (if is the master the party is disbanded)
  PARTY.SYSMESSAGE @<N> TEXT send a party sysmessage to the Nth member
  PARTY.SYSMESSAGE <UID> TEXT send a party sysmessage to a member in the party
       with the UID given
  PARTY.SYSMESSAGE TEXT send a sysmessage to the party
  PARTY.MESSAGE @<M> TEXT send a message from the Mth member to the party
  PARTY.MESSAGE @<M>,<N> TEXT send a message from the Mth member to the Nth
       member
  PARTY.MESSAGE <UID1> TEXT send a message from the <UID1> to the party
  PARTY.MESSAGE <UID1>,<UID2> TEXT send a message from <UID1> member to <UID2>
- Added: TAG/TAG0 for party.

  of spellbook (186) has been added for script purposes with internal support.
  Now the spellbooks (if not default one) can be configured to specify which
  number of the lowest spell it contains (stored in MOREZ).
- Fixed casting speel with two or more similar spell books when it does not
  exist in one of these books.
- Removed limitation to 1 byte (255) for MOREZ of spellbooks. Now it can hold
  2 bytes (65535). Please note, that satting MOREZ via MOREP is incorrect here.

28-01-05, Vjaka
- Fixed bug caused with layer_extra removal from buy menu in older clients.
- Added support for packets filterings. Please note, that you should understand
  what are you doing. You can install your handler of a packet X specifying
  PACKETx=functionname. This function will be called when the packet is going
  to be processed by the server. It has the following arguments set:
  ARGN1 = packet number (to allow using one function for different packets)
  ARGS = source client ip address
  LOCAL.0-LOCAL.9 - first 10 bytes of the packet for parsing contents
  If you do return 1 in this function, the packet will NOT be processed.
- Some exceptions debug messaging speed optimised.

29-01-05, Vjaka

- Characters with Statf_STONE cannot logout (actualy, have 1 hour logout timer).
- You can now access account properties using SERV.ACCOUNT.x. reference where x
  is the numerical index of the account (0..SERV.ACCOUNTS) [read-only]
- Fixed extra step made on sector borders.
- Fixed "return"/"return 2" in chardef triggers stopping others from launching.

04-02-05, Furio
- Added support for 4.0.8 clients.
- Fixed some arguments parsing in party functions

05-02-05, Vjaka
- Optimized time profiling on ticking objects.

07-02-05, Vjaka
- Problem with items left with switching virtual maps with one physical should
  be solved.
- Added simple mySQL support. New settings MySqlHost, MySqlUser, MySqlPassword,
  MySqlDatabase will be used to connect to the DB in case if MYSQL is set to 1.
  You will need extra .dll/.so to download for sphere installation. They will
  join the packages.

08-02-05, Vjaka
- Fixed several map support bugs with incorrect sector counting (should improve
  support of a high map numbers).

11-02-05, Vjaka
- Fixed bug causing incorrect function name lookup in several cases with some
  special chars like underline (_).
- Added debug flags 0200 and 0400 to debug experience and level changes from
  server console (if enabled).
- Experience system integrated. Few addons about defaults to config comments:
  a) experience bonus for crafting counted as a value/100.
  b) default experience set on create is str+dex/2+int.
  c) manual setting experience will alter level if configured so.
  d) dying decreases experience by 10%
  e) killing enemy will give experience depending on exp and level of target.

12-02-05, Vjaka
- Added 2 more EXP settings to config: ExperienceKoefPVP and ExperienceKoefPVM,
  controlling percents of gaining experience in PvP and PvM combat.
- Added triggers @ExpChange and @ExpLevelChange, where ARGN1 (writeable) is the
  change is going to happen. Returning 1 cancels the change.

12-02-05, Furio
- Fixed: another buffer overrun exploit in log system. Thx to Radiant for
  reporting it.
- Added: SUPPRESSCAPITALS (default 0) to enable/disable Vjaka system to avoid
  long text written only in capital letters.

14-02-05, Vjaka
- OF_Advanced_AI is now obsolete. Currently it is controlled by NPCAI setting
  in config file.
- Added MaxLoopTimes value to config (default 10000) to limit a number of
  iterations the while/for cycle could have to remove possible deadlocks making
  server to stop responding (better use this instead of main loop restart).
- Added MOVERATE to CHARDEFs. It is the percent modifyer of the speed of the
  NPC - the higher it is, the slower will the NPC be. Default is 100.
- Now double clicking on the log window in windows build will bring up an
  editor with corresponded file (if any specifyed in the same line) opened.

15-02-05, Vjaka
- Fixed one more buy menu exploit (probably, the last one) ;).
